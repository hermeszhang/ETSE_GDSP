This is the main directory and it contains the following Directories which will be explained.

1. Documenation
2. IPCores
3. Matrix_for_RBM
4. SharedLibraries
5. TestingFiles


##############################################################Documentation-Directory#################################################################

This directory contains technical documentation for the Matrix_Multiplier_IP_CORE(s)


################################################################IPCores-Directory#####################################################################

This directory contains Xilinx DSP48 and Block RAM IP Cores and they are used to compose the Matrix_Multiplier_IP_CORE(s)

#############################################################Matrix_for_RBM-Directory##################################################################

This directory contains standalone projects for separate Matrix_Multiplier_IP_CORE targeted for specific dimension of Matrices
and number format. Currently there are four versions namely

1. MATRIX_MUL_IP_CORE_CV_INT -- This is a Matrix Multiplier IP core for multiplying an integer square matrix P, by an integer column vector G.
2. MATRIX_MUL_IP_CORE_CV_REAL-- This is a Matrix Multiplier IP core for multiplying a real square matrix P, by a real column vector G.
1. MATRIX_MUL_IP_CORE_S_INT -- This is a Matrix Multiplier IP core for multiplying an integer square matrix P, by an integer square matrix G.
2. MATRIX_MUL_IP_CORE_S_REAL-- This is a Matrix Multiplier IP core for multiplying a real square matrix P, by a real square matrix G..

The naming convention adopted is similar in part for all IP cores but the difference is some IP cores have CV, S, INT, and REAL appended.

CV 	-> Column Vector (1 Square matrix, 1 Column vector)
S	-> Square Matrix (2 square matrices)
INT	-> Integer number Matrices
REAL	-> Real number Matrices

############################################################TestingFiles-Directory####################################################################

This directory contains eight important files. Four of these files are used by the Test benches of the MATRIX_MUL_IP_CORE(s) during simulation.
The files are listed and below and are briefly described.

1.	matrix_multiplier.m		--This is a matlab function that accepts an integer value which represents the dimension of a square matrix with integer numbers
					--When this function is run from matalab, it will create 3 files, 

		i.  Pdata.txt,		--This file holds the test value for P matrix.
		ii. Gdata.txt,		--This file holds the test value for G matrix.	
		iii PG_Result_Matlab.txt	

2.	real_matrix_multiplier.m	--This is a matlab function that accepts an integer value which represents the dimension of a square matrix but the fuction will generate a random matrix with real numbers.
	
		i.  Real_Pdata.txt,	--This file holds the test value for P matrix.
		ii. Real_Gdata.txt,	--This file holds the test value for G matrix.	
		iii Real_PG_Result_Matlab.txt	

3.	Gdata.txt	--This file contains test input data (integer numbers) for G matrix (stored in GRAM) and it can be regenerated by running the matrix_multiplier.m function.

4.	Pdata.txt	--This file contains test input data (integer numbers) for P matrix (stored in Block RAM) and it can be regenerated by running the matrix_multiplier.m function.

5.	Real_Gdata.txt	--This file contains test input data (real numbers) for G matrix (stored in GRAM) and it can be regenerated by running the matrix_multiplier.m function.

6.	Real_Pdata.txt	--This file contains test input data (real numbers) for P matrix (stored in Block RAM) and it can be regenerated by running the matrix_multiplier.m function.

7.	PG_Result_Matlab.txt	--When the matlab function 'matrix_multiplier.m' is executed from matlab, it creates this file then it performs all four matrix multiplicatiom PG, PtG, PGt and PtGt and saves in the file, all results are in integer number.
				--The result of the calculation are arranged in circulant format. The purpose of saving in circulant format is to make it easy to compare the results from the simulation of the MATRIX_MUL_IP_CORE(s) to that of Matlab,
				--because the IP core saves the matrix result in circlant format.

8.	Real_PG_Result_Matlab.txt	--When the matlab function 'real_matrix_multiplier.m' is executed from matlab, it creates this file then it performs all four matrix multiplicatiom PG, PtG, PGt and PtGt and saves in the file, all results are in real number.
					--The result of the calculation are arranged in circulant format. The purpose of saving in circulant format is to make it easy to compare the results from the simulation of the MATRIX_MUL_IP_CORE(s) to that of Matlab,
					--because the IP core saves the matrix result in circlant format.
